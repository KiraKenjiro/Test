						<p>
							After completing my high school courses, I made the

							dedicate the remaining four days to an internship.
							This approach has proven highly effective for me
							because I greatly appreciate the hands-on learning
							experience, allowing me to collaborate with industry
							veterans with over two decades of experience.

						<p>Tring Park School for the Performing Arts</p>
						<p>
							From the age of 5-6, I've been deeply involved in

							singing. Over the years, I've had the privilege of
							touring with various agencies and gaining acceptance
							into multiple film and modeling agencies. However,
							my perspective shifted when I attended Tring Park,
							leading me to choose a different path within the
							industry: lighting design. I've developed a profound
							passion for the technical aspects behind the scenes,
							and this has become my new focus.
